  abstract = "Despite global efforts to monitor, mitigate against, and prevent
              trash (mismanaged solid waste) pollution, no harmonized trash
              typology system has been widely adopted worldwide. This impedes
              the merging of datasets and comparative analyses. We addressed
              this problem by 1) assessing the state of trash typology and
              comparability, 2) developing a standardized and harmonized
              framework of relational tables and tools, and 3) informing
              practitioners about challenges and potential solutions. We
              analyzed 68 trash survey lists to assess similarities and
              differences in classification. We created comprehensive
              harmonized hierarchical tables and alias tables for item and
              material classes. On average, the 68 survey lists had 20.8\% of
              item classes in common and 29.9\% of material classes in common.
              Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the 68 surveys were
              not significantly different regarding organization type,
              ecosystem focus, or substrate focus. We built the Trash Taxonomy
              Tool (TTT) web-based application with query features and open
              access at openanalysis.org/trashtaxonomy. The TTT can be applied
              to improve, create, and compare trash surveys, and provides
              practitioners with tools to integrate datasets and maximize
              comparability. The use of TTT will ultimately facilitate
              improvements in assessing trends across space and time,
              identifying targets for mitigation, evaluating the effectiveness
              of prevention measures, informing policymaking, and holding
              producers responsible.",
